"""
Remove what would break NetBox pages once this plugin is gone. Run it while
the plugin is still installed, right before taking it out of PLUGINS.

The plugin never changes NetBox's own tables, but NetBox keeps rows about
any object, relationships and logical services included: change log and journal entries, bookmarks,
notifications, tag assignments and the like. Once the plugin's models are
gone, a page listing such a row can't load the object behind it and fails
with a server error. A tag used on a relationship breaks that tag's page, and a
custom field offered on relationships breaks that field's page.

So this deletes those rows, and takes the plugin's object types off custom
fields, custom links, export templates, saved filters, tags, event rules and
permissions (deleting the ones that were only about this plugin), and
deletes custom fields whose values are this plugin's objects.

The plugin's own tables are left alone; `migrate netbox_relationships zero`
removes those.
