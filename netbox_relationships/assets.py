"""
Serves the graph's JavaScript and CSS (Cytoscape.js and graph.js) from the
plugin's own folder.

They are not Django static files on purpose: static files only reach the
web server after `collectstatic`, which a plugin installed or updated in a
container often never gets. Served from here, a restart is all an update
needs. Browsers cache them; the plugin version in the address makes them
load again after an upgrade.
